## Portfolio Site

My personal portfolio site created using the Jekyll static site generator. This site is based on the Phantom template Jamie Gibbs has open-sourced which can be found [here](https://github.com/jamigibbs/phantom).

## Building-and running it

The site can be built by running the following commands:

```sh
gem install bundler
bundle install
```

`sudo` permission may be required to invoke them. To run the site:

```sh
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Then visit `http://localhost:4000` to see the landing page.
