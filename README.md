## Portfolio Site

My personal portfolio site created using the Jekyll static site generator.

## Building-and running it

The site can be built by running the following commands:

```sh
gem install bundler
bundle install
```

`sudo` permission may be required to invoke them. To run the site:

```sh
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Then visit `http://localhost:4000` to see the landing page.

## Credits

 I'd like to credit Jami Gibbs for his beautiful, elegant yet simple Phantom template that he open-sourced. The Phantom template can be found [here](https://github.com/jamigibbs/phantom).
